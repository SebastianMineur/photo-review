# Photo Review

This is a web app written as an exercise for a Front-end Development course I attended.

It allows users to register and sign in, then create albums and upload images. Links to albums can then be shared with anyone, and they can select a subset of images to submit, creating a new album on the original user's account.

The purpose of this exercise was to practice user authentication, user-generated content and file uploads.

## Tech stack
